<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a computer science and mathematics graduate with very little skill 
  in web development and coding. While pursuing my degree, web development
  was not yet taken very serious by the institution I went to, and after 
  graduation, i did not get any job that used skills in web development, as
  such I am very novice.
</p>

<p>I have decided to pursue this course after realising that my skill are slowly
  becoming obsolete and I am slowly becoming unemployable. Pursuing this course
  is just the beginning of a very long journey in advancing my computer science skills.
</p>

<p>
  I strongly believe that after completing this course and others that will follow, I
  will eligible for a couple of employements; on site, remote or hybrid.
